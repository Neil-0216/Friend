<div class="Intro-description"><h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Friend – your safe space to be heard. </h2>
    
    <p> 
        
        We understand that life can sometimes feel overwhelming — whether it's the pressure of school, the stress of work, or the pain of personal struggles. At Friend, we believe no one should go through hard times alone.

That’s why we created this platform — to lend a listening ear and provide emotional support for anyone who needs it. Whether you’re facing anxiety, burnout, relationship issues, or simply need someone to talk to, Friend is here for you.

We are not therapists or doctors — we are people who care. Our goal is to offer a judgment-free space where you can share your thoughts, find understanding, and take that first step toward healing.

No advice unless you ask for it. No pressure. Just someone who listens.

At Friend, you’re never alone. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Why We Exist</h2>

<p> 
    
    At some point, all of us needed someone to talk to — not a professional, not a hotline, just a person who would listen without interrupting, fixing, or making it about them. Friend is here to be that person.

We believe in the power of a simple conversation. Sometimes just letting things out helps you breathe a little easier, sleep a little better, or find your next step forward. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>What You Can Expect</h2>

<p> 
    
    <b>Mental Health Check-ins</b>— Feel free to talk about stress, anxiety, or anything weighing on your mind. 
    <br>
    <b>School Struggles?</b> — We get it. Assignments, pressure, deadlines — vent it out. 
    <br>
    <b>Work Life Overload?</b> — Talk to us about burnout, toxic bosses, or feeling stuck. 
    <br>
    <b>Relationship Feels</b> — Whether it’s heartbreak, conflict, or confusion, we’re here. 
    <br>
    <b>Just Feeling Off?</b> — No reason needed. You can talk to us about anything or nothing at all. </p> 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>You’re Not Alone</h2>

<p> 
    
    The biggest myth we tell ourselves is that no one would understand — but here, you’ll find people who do. People who’ve been there. People who care.

    So take a deep breath. You’re in the right place.
    
    Friend is here. Let’s talk. </p>
